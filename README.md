# checkered.js

A micro checking library. (less than 5kb)
Originally forked from [is.js](https://arasatasaygin.github.io/is.js/), I'm making it smaller because I want to be able to put it onto [microjs](http://microjs.com/) because I'm some kind of child who just WANTS that.

##This is a general-purpose check library.
- No dependencies
- Node and Browser ready
- Written with Commonjs modules, output by Webpack
- Written to be micro (less than 5kb) because I wanted to challenge myself to do it!
