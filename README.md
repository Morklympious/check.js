A micro checking library. (less than 5kb)
I'm bastardizing it and making it smaller to accommodate more common use-cases.

##This is a general-purpose check library.
- No dependencies
- Node and Browser ready
- Written with Commonjs modules, output by Webpack
- Written to be micro (less than 5kb) because I wanted to challenge myself to do it!
