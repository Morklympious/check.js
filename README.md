# check.js

A micro checking library. (Micro meaning less than 5kb (which I'm still working on))
Originally forked from [is.js](https://arasatasaygin.github.io/is.js/), I'm making it smaller because I want to be able to put it onto [microjs](http://microjs.com/) because I'm some kind of man-baby who wants to do that.

## This is a general-purpose check library.
- Node and Browser ready
- Written with ES2015 modules, output via Rollup and compilation by Buble
- Written to be micro (less than 5kb) because I wanted to challenge myself to do it!
